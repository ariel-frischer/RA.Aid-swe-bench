# SWE Lite RA-AID

A lightweight version of SWE Bench focused on the RA-AID agent.

## Description

This project provides a streamlined interface for running the RA-AID agent on a simplified version of the SWE Bench dataset. It's designed to make it easier to test and evaluate the RA-AID agent's performance on software engineering tasks.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://gitlab.com/ariel-frischer/swe-lite-ra-aid.git
cd swe-lite-ra-aid

# Install dependencies using Poetry
poetry install
```

## Requirements

- Python >=3.9, <3.13
- Poetry for dependency management
- RA-AID ^0.12.0

## Usage

The main workflow consists of:

1. Generate predictions using the RA-AID model:
```bash
make run
```
This will process the SWE-bench Lite dataset and generate predictions in the `predictions/ra_aid_predictions` directory.

2. Evaluate predictions and generate a report:
```bash
make evaluate
```
This will run the evaluation pipeline and generate a detailed report of model performance.

### Available Make Commands

```bash
make install      # Install project dependencies using Poetry
make run         # Run the main prediction script
make test        # Run tests using pytest
make clean       # Remove Python cache files and predictions
make format      # Format code using black
make clean-repos # Clean up cloned repositories
make add-model-name # Add model metadata to predictions
make evaluate    # Run evaluation and generate report
```

## Dataset Structure
Data Instances

An example of a SWE-bench datum is as follows:
instance_id: (str) - A formatted instance identifier, usually as repo_owner__repo_name-PR-number.
patch: (str) - The gold patch, the patch generated by the PR (minus test-related code), that resolved the issue.
repo: (str) - The repository owner/name identifier from GitHub.
base_commit: (str) - The commit hash of the repository representing the HEAD of the repository before the solution PR is applied.
hints_text: (str) - Comments made on the issue prior to the creation of the solution PRâ€™s first commit creation date.
created_at: (str) - The creation date of the pull request.
test_patch: (str) - A test-file patch that was contributed by the solution PR.
problem_statement: (str) - The issue title and body.
version: (str) - Installation version to use for running evaluation.
environment_setup_commit: (str) - commit hash to use for environment setup and installation.
FAIL_TO_PASS: (str) - A json list of strings that represent the set of tests resolved by the PR and tied to the issue resolution.
PASS_TO_PASS: (str) - A json list of strings that represent tests that should pass before and after the PR application.
