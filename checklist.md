# Submission Checklist

> ⚠️ PLEASE READ ALL OF THIS DOCUMENT BEFORE MAKING A SUBMISSION TO SWE-BENCH

Please go through the following checklist to (1) make sure your submission follows the leaderboard guidelines, and (2) confirm that you have included all necessary assets for your submission.

### `README.md`

`SUBMISSION_MODE = True` is needed to pass all these tests.

Please copy paste this checklist in your `README.md` and confirm the following:
- [X] Is a pass@1 submission (does not attempt the same task instance more than once)
- [X] Does not use SWE-bench test knowledge (`PASS_TO_PASS`, `FAIL_TO_PASS`)
- [X] Does not use the `hints` field in SWE-bench
- [X] Does not have web-browsing OR has taken steps to prevent lookup of SWE-bench solutions via web-browsing

Refer to the following for more information about what your submission should and should not include:

**Pass@1**: This leaderboard is a pass@1 leaderboard. This means that you may only attempt each test task instance once. So for example, for your submission, you're not allowed to run your system once, solve some task instances, and then try the ones you didn't solve again. You need to attempt every task just once, evaluate locally (once), and then submit. Please explicitly state in your README that your submission is pass@1.

**Test Use**: Does your system use any SWE-bench test knowledge, including `PASS_TO_PASS` and `FAIL_TO_PASS` tests? Does your system use the `hints` field in SWE-bench? The answer should be no on both counts.

**Web Browsing**: If your system has web-browsing abilities, please indicate what steps you took to make sure it could not browse to the GitHub repos (or other sources, such as mirrors) to find the actual solutions for SWE-bench tasks. Potential steps you can take include blocking specific GitHub URLs in your system's web browser, and manually inspecting trajectories to make sure that no unallowed behavior is happening.

### `metadata.yaml`
Metadata for how result is shown on website. Please include the following fields:

```yaml
name: The name of your leaderboard entry
oss: `true` if your system is open-source
site: URL/link to more information about your system
verified: `false` (See below for results verification)
org_logo: URL/link to your organization's logo, if applicable
model: The language model used, if any
```

* For the language model, it's ok to use either proprietary or open-source models. We just want to know.
